# YoutubeClone
Our first project will require you to draw on your new understanding of working with media by building YouTube’s video player page (the example video is one where I describe making contributions to open source).

The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

How far you go from there in terms of styling is up to you – some of you will already be more comfortable with CSS than others, so knock yourself out.

There are other elements on the YouTube page which are produced with Javascript and you don’t need to worry about them – basically, anything that changes the page by clicking on it is wired up using Javascript. An example is the “Show more” link below the description, which dynamically expands to show more. Again, don’t worry about these dynamic elements!.

Also, don’t worry about making the comment form work properly… your goal is to make the page look similar and display video.

Requirements shortcut list
As this is your first project, we prepared a shortcut list of requirements. This list is based on requirements written in the task description and will help you control your progress.

Please remember: In the upcoming tasks you should be able to create a similar shortcut list on your own.
