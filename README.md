Embedding Images and Video.
This project consists of building an HTML document that matches the appearance of youtube video player page.

Additional description about the project and its features.

This Project is the only part of the “Basic HTML Page Structure” lesson that we will complete, all other sections in this lesson will be skipped as you should be already familiar with basics. If you feel like you need some refresh, go back and read all lessons in this section.
Your task is to clone YouTube’s video player page. Please use web archive link: http://archive.today/Bss88 as a source page.

Getting Started
This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally. Modify this file to match your project, remove sections that don't apply. For example: delete the testing section if the currect project doesn't require testing.
Our first project will require you to draw on your new understanding of working with media by building YouTube’s video player page (the example video is one where I describe making contributions to open source).

The goal here isn’t to produce an exact replica of the YouTube video page, but to focus on making the media elements show up. That means two things – embedding the YouTube video player into the page so it actually plays and showing little thumbnail images along the right side.

How far you go from there in terms of styling is up to you – some of you will already be more comfortable with CSS than others, so knock yourself out.

There are other elements on the YouTube page which are produced with Javascript and you don’t need to worry about them – basically, anything that changes the page by clicking on it is wired up using Javascript. An example is the “Show more” link below the description, which dynamically expands to show more. Again, don’t worry about these dynamic elements!.

Also, don’t worry about making the comment form work properly… your goal is to make the page look similar and display video.

Requirements shortcut list
As this is your first project, we prepared a shortcut list of requirements. This list is based on requirements written in the task description and will help you control your progress.

Please remember: In the upcoming tasks you should be able to create a similar shortcut list on your own.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.
